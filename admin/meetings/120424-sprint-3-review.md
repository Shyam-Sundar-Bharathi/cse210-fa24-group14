Sprint Review Report
Sprint Highlights
During this sprint, the team focused on enhancing the markdown functionality and resolving conflicts in code integration. Below is a summary of our achievements and learnings:
1.	Markdown Functionality
o	Feature Demonstration: Phil demonstrated the new markdown feature. The functionality was improved to ensure that when markdown is toggled off, the content in markdown format becomes non-editable. However, this also inadvertently affected the text label for the "code/text" switch.
o	Feedback and Actions:
	Rashi pointed out that this behavior aligns with markdown’s typical operation.
	A solution was proposed to introduce an additional button for toggling markdown editing separately.
	The text label bug was acknowledged and marked for fixing.
2.	Development Efforts
o	Phil and Jet collaborated to implement and refine the markdown feature.
o	Progress was made on rebasing the feature branch, although some initial conflicts arose.
3.	Conflict Resolution
o	Zihan attempted to resolve the conflicts but missed rebasing the branch, leading to some persistent issues.
o	Rashi subsequently addressed and resolved the rebasing problem, ensuring the feature was integrated smoothly.
Key Takeaways
•	The team successfully developed and demoed a new markdown feature, improving content handling and non-editable states.
•	Communication and collaborative problem-solving were critical, especially in resolving integration conflicts.
•	Future sprints could benefit from a more streamlined conflict resolution process, including ensuring all steps like rebasing are completed before feature merging.
Next Steps
•	Finalize and fix the markdown-related text bug.
•	Implement the additional button for toggling markdown editing as suggested.
•	Continue refining the markdown feature based on user feedback.
Conclusion
The sprint demonstrated the team's adaptability and focus on delivering functional improvements while resolving technical challenges efficiently.
