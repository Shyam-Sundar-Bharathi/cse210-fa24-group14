# ADR-004: Testing Framework

## Context and Problem Statement
Our browser extension project requires a robust testing setup to ensure code quality, reliability, and smooth user experience across various browsers. We considered frameworks that could handle both unit and end-to-end (E2E) testing efficiently, given our tech stack is vanilla JavaScript, and the testing needs to encompass browser extension components such as popup and content scripts. 

Initially, we leaned toward a single framework, Playwright, for both unit and E2E testing. However, due to performance concerns and the specific needs of unit testing, we decided to pivot to a combination of Jest and Playwright.

## Decision Drivers
1. **Performance**: Running unit tests should be fast and efficient, without the overhead of spinning up a browser instance, which is more appropriate for E2E testing scenarios.
2. **Testing Scope**: Unit tests need to focus on individual pieces of functionality, while E2E tests should validate the overall behavior of the extension in different browser environments.
3. **Mocking Capabilities**: We require the ability to mock browser APIs, such as `chrome.storage.sync`, to thoroughly test business logic in isolation.
4. **Ease of Use and Maintenance**: We prefer frameworks that are easy to set up and maintain while providing comprehensive testing features.

## Considered Options
### 1. **Playwright (Original Choice)**
   - **Description**: A powerful testing framework that supports testing browser extensions across multiple browsers with modern async/await syntax.
   - **Pros**:
     - Built-in support for browser extension testing.
     - Can test across Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
     - Browser context isolation for reliable tests.
     - Unified environment for both unit and E2E testing, simplifying the learning curve.
   - **Cons**:
     - Launching a browser instance for unit tests is inefficient and slow, increasing the total runtime significantly.
     - Not ideal for lightweight unit tests that should execute quickly.
   - **Conclusion**: More suitable for E2E testing but introduces performance bottlenecks for unit tests.

### 2. **Jest + Playwright (Chosen Strategy)**
   - **Description**: A combination of Jest for unit testing and Playwright for E2E testing.
   - **Pros**:
     - **Jest**:
       - Fast execution for unit tests, no need to bring up a browser instance.
       - Built-in mocking and utility functions, suitable for testing isolated logic.
       - Ability to mock `chrome.storage.sync` APIs, simulating browser storage in a controlled way.
     - **Playwright**:
       - Excellent for E2E testing with support for multiple browsers.
       - Powerful features for simulating browser environments and testing extension behavior.
       - Async/await syntax for clear and concise test cases.
     - **Overall Benefits**:
       - Efficient use of resources: Unit tests run quickly with Jest, while Playwright handles more resource-intensive E2E testing.
       - Better separation of concerns: Unit tests focus on functionality, and E2E tests validate integration and user flows.
   - **Cons**:
     - Requires learning and maintaining two separate frameworks.
     - Slightly more complex setup compared to using a single framework.
   - **Conclusion**: Balances performance and functionality, leveraging Jest for fast unit tests and Playwright for comprehensive E2E tests.

### 3. **Mocha + Chai (for Unit Testing)**
   - **Description**: A flexible testing framework often used for JavaScript projects, paired with Chai for assertions.
   - **Pros**: Highly customizable and allows greater flexibility in test configuration.
   - **Cons**: More setup and configuration required compared to Jest; lacks built-in mocking and other modern conveniences.
   - **Conclusion**: Not chosen due to the additional complexity and lack of built-in features.

### 4. **Cypress (for E2E Testing)**
   - **Description**: A user-friendly framework for E2E testing that is easy to set up but has limited support for browser extension testing.
   - **Pros**: Simpler setup and clear syntax.
   - **Cons**: Limited to testing in Chrome-like environments; lacks robust support for browser extensions compared to Playwright.
   - **Conclusion**: Not chosen due to limited browser extension support.

## Decision
We have decided to use **Jest for unit testing** and **Playwright for E2E testing**. Jest will handle lightweight, performance-critical unit tests with the ability to mock browser APIs, ensuring our business logic is tested efficiently. Playwright will manage E2E tests, simulating real-world scenarios across multiple browsers to validate the overall behavior and integration of our extension.

## Consequences
### Positive Consequences
- **Optimized Performance**: Unit tests are significantly faster using Jest, avoiding the overhead of browser instances.
- **Effective Testing**: Playwright provides comprehensive E2E testing, ensuring our extension works correctly across different browsers.
- **Mocking Flexibility**: Jest’s built-in mocking capabilities simplify testing of browser-specific APIs, such as `chrome.storage.sync`.
- **Improved CI/CD**: Both frameworks integrate well with our CI/CD pipeline, providing clear reporting and efficient test execution.

### Negative Consequences
- **Learning Curve**: Team members need to be familiar with both Jest and Playwright, which may require additional learning time.
- **Framework Management**: Maintaining two separate frameworks could increase the complexity of the project setup and ongoing maintenance.

### Trade-Offs
- **Single Framework Simplicity vs. Dual Framework Efficiency**: We traded off the simplicity of a single framework for the performance and suitability benefits of using Jest and Playwright together.
- **Fast Execution vs. Comprehensive Testing**: Jest provides fast execution for unit tests, while Playwright ensures robust E2E testing.

## Related Architectural Decisions
- **Branching Strategy**: Our chosen testing frameworks align with our `main`-`feature/fix` branching strategy, enabling efficient testing and feedback loops for code changes.

## Notes and Future Considerations
- **Test Coverage**: We will regularly review our test coverage to ensure that critical parts of the code are well-tested. If performance becomes an issue, we may consider additional optimizations.
- **Browser API Mocking**: Jest’s mocking capabilities will be leveraged to simulate browser environments effectively, especially for APIs like `chrome.storage.sync`.
- **Framework Updates**: We will monitor updates to both Jest and Playwright to take advantage of performance improvements and new features.

This decision provides a robust and efficient testing setup, ensuring high-quality code and a smooth development workflow.
