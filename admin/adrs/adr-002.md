# ADR-002: Branching Strategy

## Context and Problem Statement
Our development team needed to establish a branching strategy for our project. We considered various approaches, specifically comparing a simpler `main`-`feature/fix` strategy with a more complex `main`-`dev`-`feature/fix` strategy. Our goal was to adopt a workflow that supports efficient development while integrating well with our Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, which includes automated unit testing, linting, and deployment processes.

## Decision Drivers
1. **Simplicity and Efficiency**: We aim to keep our workflow simple to avoid unnecessary complexity and overhead in managing branches, which can slow development.
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Our CI/CD pipeline runs automated tests, code quality checks, and deployments. The strategy must prevent unnecessary runs that could cause inefficiencies or potential failures if branches are not correctly configured.
3. **Fast Feedback Loop**: Developers should get prompt CI/CD system feedback to ensure code quality and identify issues early. The branching strategy should facilitate this.
4. **Collaboration and Merge Simplicity**: Our strategy should minimize merge conflicts and the need for complex branch synchronization, making collaboration straightforward.

## Considered Options
### 1. **`main`-`feature/fix` (Chosen Strategy)**
   - **Description**: A simple branching model where:
     - `main`: The primary branch containing production-ready code.
     - `feature/fix`: Short-lived branches for developing new features or fixing bugs merged directly into `main` once completed.
   - **Pros**:
     - **Simplifies Branch Management**: Developers only need to worry about two types of branches, reducing overhead.
     - **Efficient CI/CD Integration**: CI/CD processes run only on `feature/fix` branches and `main,` avoiding redundant builds or test runs that a `dev` branch could trigger.
     - **Faster Feedback**: Changes are tested and reviewed sooner, as there is no intermediate `dev` branch.
     - **Reduced Merge Complexity**: Direct merges into `main` help prevent unnecessary rebasing or conflicts arising from an intermediate branch.
   - **Cons**:
     - **Risk of Unstable Code**: Since features are merged directly into `main`, there’s a slight risk that incomplete or unstable code could be introduced if CI/CD checks are not robust.
     - **Limited Staging Area**: There’s no dedicated `dev` branch for testing integrations of multiple features before merging into `main`.

### 2. **`main`-`dev`-`feature/fix`**
   - **Description**: A more complex strategy with:
     - `main`: The production-ready branch.
     - `dev`: An integration branch where features are merged and tested before moving to `main.`
     - `feature/fix`: Branches for developing new features or fixing bugs merged into `dev.`
   - **Pros**:
     - **Integration Testing**: Provides an area (`dev`) for integrating and testing multiple features simultaneously before merging into `main.`
     - **Staging Environment**: Allows more thorough pre-release testing, which can improve stability.
   - **Cons**:
     - **Complex Workflow**: Managing an additional branch increases the complexity of the development process.
     - **CI/CD Complications**: The CI/CD pipeline must be configured to run on `dev` and `main,` potentially causing inefficiencies, redundant testing, or incorrect deployments if the configuration isn’t perfect.
     - **Delayed Feedback**: Changes might not be tested on `main` until later, slowing down the feedback loop.

## Decision
We have implemented the `main feature/fix` branching strategy. This approach balances simplicity with the needs of our CI/CD pipeline and facilitates a faster feedback loop for developers. Each `feature/fix` branch will undergo rigorous CI/CD checks (e.g., unit testing, linting, etc.) before merging into `main,` ensuring code quality while maintaining an efficient workflow.

## Consequences
### Positive Consequences
- **Simpler Workflow**: Developers spend less time managing branches and more time writing and reviewing code.
- **Efficient CI/CD Execution**: The CI/CD pipeline is optimized, with testing and deployment occurring only on relevant branches. This minimizes resource use and avoids the complications of an additional `dev` branch.
- **Faster Iterations**: Code changes are merged into `main` more rapidly, allowing for a quicker release cycle and better responsiveness to issues or new feature requests.
- **Easier Collaboration**: With fewer branches to manage, the risk of complex merge conflicts and integration issues is reduced.

### Negative Consequences
- **Potential Stability Risks**: Merging features directly into `main` increases the reliance on CI/CD to catch issues. If the CI/CD checks fail or are insufficient, unstable code could reach production.
- **No Dedicated Integration Environment**: Without a `dev` branch, there’s no built-in space for testing multiple features together before deploying to production. This may limit pre-release testing for larger projects.

### Trade-Offs
- **Simplicity vs. Stability**: We traded off a more complex but potentially more stable workflow (with `dev`) for a simpler and more efficient one. This places a higher emphasis on robust CI/CD practices.
- **Speed vs. Safety**: The strategy favors the speed of development and deployment, with the understanding that stability must be maintained through comprehensive automated testing.

## Related Architectural Decisions
- **CI/CD Configuration**: This decision directly impacts our CI/CD setup, which must be configured to automatically run tests on `feature/fix` branches and `main.`

## Notes and Future Considerations
- **CI/CD Enhancements**: As the project evolves, we may revisit this strategy if our needs change. For example, if more pre-release testing becomes necessary, we could consider reintroducing an integration branch.
- **Code Quality Assurance**: To mitigate the risk of unstable code, we will enforce strict CI/CD checks and implement thorough code reviews before merging into `main.`
- **Branch Protection**: We may implement branch protection rules on `main` to ensure that only reviewed and tested code is merged.

This branching strategy enables us to deliver high-quality code efficiently, making the most of our CI/CD system while keeping our workflow simple and developer-friendly.
