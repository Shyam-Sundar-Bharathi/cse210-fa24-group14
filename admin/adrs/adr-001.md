# ADR-001: Choosing a Browser Extension

## Context and Problem Statement
Our Greenfield project, aimed at building a developer journal tool that pairs notes with web resources, requires careful consideration of the architectural form. We explored options such as developing a standalone local application, a web-based app, or a browser extension. The key challenge is to create a seamless experience for developers who frequently refer to and annotate web-based technical resources, all while working within the constraints of our limited four-week development window.

## Decision Drivers
1. **Ease of Access and User Flow**: Developers often need to annotate, reference, and organize web content efficiently. A browser extension provides an integrated experience, minimizing the disruption of switching between different tools or applications.
2. **Development Timeline**: With only four weeks to deliver the MVP, we need an option that can be implemented swiftly and efficiently, without the need for extensive infrastructure or backend development.
3. **Technical Simplicity**: Avoiding the complexities of setting up a server backend or handling extensive offline functionalities is crucial. A browser extension simplifies this by leveraging the browser environment.
4. **Memory and Resource Management**: A lightweight architecture ensures that our solution doesn’t consume excessive system resources, which is critical for users who often run memory-intensive developer tools.
5. **Security Considerations**: Given the potential security implications of our tool (such as accessing and modifying web content), a browser extension allows us to focus on browser-based security mechanisms and permissions.

## Considered Options
### 1. **Standalone Local App**
   - **Pros**:
     - Full control over the user interface and resource management.
     - Ability to optimize performance without the restrictions of a browser environment.
   - **Cons**:
     - Installation and setup create friction for users, as it breaks their typical browsing workflow.
     - More time-consuming to develop and test, especially with the need to handle platform-specific features (e.g., different operating systems).
     - Difficult to access and interact with live web content seamlessly.
   - **Complexities**:
     - Managing local file storage and synchronization.
     - Developing features that are inherently browser-based would be more cumbersome.

### 2. **Web App**
   - **Pros**:
     - Easily accessible from any device with a web browser.
     - Potential for future enhancements, like cloud-based storage and collaboration features.
   - **Cons**:
     - Requires developing a robust backend for data storage, user authentication, and possibly real-time features, which would complicate the MVP.
     - Splits the user’s focus between the web app and the resource they are referencing, which is counterproductive.
     - Security and privacy concerns when handling user data over the internet.
   - **Complexities**:
     - Setting up a backend and ensuring data security.
     - User experience is disrupted by requiring constant navigation between the web app and other tabs.

### 3. **Browser Extension (Chosen Option)**
   - **Pros**:
     - Seamless integration with the user's existing browsing experience.
     - Quick and efficient development, focusing primarily on client-side logic and UI.
     - Access to browser APIs to interact with web pages directly, which is core to our tool’s functionality.
     - Reduces cognitive load by allowing real-time annotation alongside web content.
   - **Cons**:
     - Limited to browsers that support the extension, restricting cross-platform use.
     - Some advanced functionalities may be constrained by browser API limitations.
   - **Complexities**:
     - Managing permissions carefully to maintain security.
     - Handling dynamic or complex web content that may not render uniformly across all browsers.

## Decision
We have chosen to implement the project as a **browser extension**. This decision aligns well with our need for rapid development, an integrated user experience, and resource efficiency. By leveraging browser APIs, we can create a tool that allows users to view and annotate web content side-by-side, providing a seamless and cohesive experience.

The browser extension will enable us to address the primary pain points of our target personas—like context switching and scattered notes—without the added complexity of developing a standalone application or a full web app with backend support.

## Consequences
### Positive Consequences
- **User Experience**: Users can create and view journal entries directly alongside the web content they are annotating. This will improve productivity and reduce the disruption caused by switching between applications.
- **Simplified Development**: We can focus our efforts on client-side features, reducing the need for backend infrastructure and complex data handling.
- **Faster Time to Market**: The MVP can be developed, tested, and refined within our four-week timeline, meeting our project deadlines without sacrificing core functionality.

### Negative Consequences
- **Browser Dependency**: The tool will only work in supported browsers, limiting accessibility for users who work in environments without extension support.
- **API Limitations**: Browser APIs may restrict some desired functionalities, requiring creative workarounds or feature limitations.
- **Performance Constraints**: Browser extensions are subject to memory and performance limitations imposed by the browser, which we must carefully manage to ensure a smooth experience.

### Trade-Offs
- **Feature Limitations vs. Development Simplicity**: By opting for a browser extension, we simplify development at the cost of limiting future feature expansions. We may need to revisit our architectural decisions if more complex requirements arise.

## Notes and Future Considerations
- **Future Enhancements**: We may explore developing a web app or standalone app version in the future if user demand or project scope expands. This could include features like cloud syncing, advanced data analytics, or offline capabilities.
- **Browser Support**: Initial development will focus on Chrome with plans to extend compatibility based on user feedback and demand.
- **Potential Challenges**: We anticipate challenges such as handling dynamic content and browser API limitations, which may require creative solutions or scope adjustments.
