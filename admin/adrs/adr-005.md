# ADR-005: Switching from Chrome Storage Sync to IndexedDB

## Context and Problem Statement

Our developer notes Chrome extension requires a reliable and scalable storage solution to handle user data such as notes, tags, and preferences. Initially, we utilized Chrome Storage Sync due to its simplicity and built-in synchronization across devices. However, as the volume of user data increased, we encountered significant limitations, particularly in terms of storage capacity and performance.

Chrome Storage Sync has a storage limit of 102,400 bytes per item and a total quota of 512,000 bytes, which proved insufficient for our application's needs. This restriction led to issues such as data truncation and failed sync operations, especially for users with large notes or extensive metadata.

To address these issues, we decided to transition from Chrome Storage Sync to IndexedDB, a more flexible and scalable client-side storage option.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Storage Capacity**: Chrome Storage Sync's size limitations are inadequate for our application's requirements. IndexedDB offers virtually unlimited storage (subject to browser policies and user disk space).
2. **Performance**: IndexedDB allows for efficient storage and retrieval of large datasets, supporting complex queries without significant performance degradation.
3. **Data Structure**: IndexedDB provides support for structured storage, enabling more sophisticated data organization and retrieval mechanisms compared to Chrome Storage Sync's key-value storage.
4. **Flexibility**: IndexedDB does not impose strict limits on data size, making it suitable for applications with dynamic and unpredictable storage needs.
5. **Synchronization**: While Chrome Storage Sync offers automatic data synchronization across devices, our application can implement a custom sync mechanism if needed.

## Considered Options

### 1. **Continue Using Chrome Storage Sync (Rejected)**
   - **Pros**:
     - Built-in synchronization across devices.
     - Simple API with low development overhead.
   - **Cons**:
     - Insufficient storage capacity for user data.
     - Risk of data loss or truncation as users create larger notes.
     - Limited scalability as the application grows.

### 2. **Switch to IndexedDB (Chosen Strategy)**
   - **Pros**:
     - Virtually unlimited storage capacity.
     - Structured data storage with support for indexing and querying.
     - Improved performance for handling large datasets.
     - Well-supported in modern browsers, including Chrome.
   - **Cons**:
     - Requires implementing a custom synchronization solution for cross-device support.
     - Slightly steeper learning curve compared to Chrome Storage Sync.

### 3. **Hybrid Approach: Use Chrome Storage Sync for Metadata and IndexedDB for Notes (Partially Considered)**
   - **Pros**:
     - Leverages Chrome Storage Sync's sync capabilities for lightweight metadata.
     - Stores large data in IndexedDB, bypassing Chrome Storage Sync's size limitations.
   - **Cons**:
     - Adds complexity to the storage architecture.
     - Requires maintaining two storage solutions, increasing the development and maintenance burden.

## Decision

We decided to switch entirely to IndexedDB for data storage. This choice ensures scalability and performance for handling large datasets while providing the flexibility to organize and query data efficiently. 

Although Chrome Storage Sync's automatic synchronization is a valuable feature, its limitations outweigh the benefits for our use case. We will explore implementing a custom synchronization mechanism using external APIs or user-driven exports/imports if cross-device sync becomes a priority.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Scalability**: IndexedDB accommodates large datasets, eliminating the storage limitations of Chrome Storage Sync.
- **Performance**: Enhanced read and write performance, especially for complex queries and larger datasets.
- **Data Organization**: Ability to implement sophisticated data structures and indexing for efficient access.

### Negative Consequences
- **Synchronization**: Requires developing a custom solution for cross-device synchronization, which may increase development effort.
- **Learning Curve**: Team members need to familiarize themselves with IndexedDB's API and usage patterns.

## Trade-Offs

- **Built-in Sync vs. Storage Scalability**: We prioritized storage capacity and flexibility over Chrome Storage Sync's built-in synchronization.
- **Development Effort vs. Long-Term Benefits**: While IndexedDB requires more initial setup, it ensures long-term scalability and reliability for our application.

## Related Architectural Decisions

- **Testing Framework (ADR-004)**: Our decision aligns with the testing framework, as IndexedDB can be mocked and tested effectively using Jest during unit testing.

---

## Notes and Future Considerations

- **Custom Sync Mechanism**: We will investigate options for cross-device synchronization, such as integrating with cloud storage APIs or enabling user-driven sync/export.
- **Data Migration**: A migration script will be implemented to transition existing user data from Chrome Storage Sync to IndexedDB seamlessly.
- **Monitoring and Updates**: We will monitor IndexedDB's performance and browser compatibility, ensuring continued reliability and efficiency.

This decision positions our application for robust growth while maintaining a high-quality user experience.
