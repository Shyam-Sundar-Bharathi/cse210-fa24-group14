 # ADR-003: Syncing Strategy

## Context and Problem Statement
Our browser extension project requires a data persistence and syncing strategy that supports storing user data (e.g., journal entries, paired URLs) and syncing it across multiple devices for a consistent user experience. Given our goal of keeping the project lightweight and minimizing complexity, we must decide how to store and synchronize data effectively without using a backend server or server-side infrastructure.

## Decision Drivers
1. **Simplicity**: We want to avoid the complexity and overhead of managing a backend server, which would require infrastructure setup, security measures, and ongoing maintenance.
2. **Lightweight Architecture**: A serverless approach aligns with our project’s aim to be simple, fast, and easy to deploy.
3. **User Experience**: Users should have a seamless experience, with their data accessible and up-to-date across devices. The chosen strategy should work well with the browser environment.
4. **Reliability and Performance**: Data should be stored and synced efficiently without impacting the performance of the extension or the user’s browser.
5. **Privacy and Security**: Data should be stored securely, adhering to best practices for protecting user information, especially when syncing across devices.

## Considered Options
### 1. **Local Storage and Browser Sync (Chosen Strategy)**
   - **Description**: Use the browser’s built-in cache (e.g., `localStorage` or `IndexedDB`) to store data locally on the user’s device. Leverage browser-provided syncing APIs (e.g., Chrome’s `chrome.storage.sync`) for syncing across devices.
   - **Pros**:
     - **No Server Infrastructure**: Eliminates the need for backend setup, reducing complexity and cost.
     - **Seamless Syncing**: Most modern browsers offer built-in syncing capabilities, allowing data to be shared across devices as long as the user is signed in with their browser account.
     - **Efficient Data Storage**: A browser cache ensures fast data access and minimal latency.
     - **Lightweight and Fast**: The extension remains lightweight and easy to install, as all data management is handled locally or through the browser’s sync features.
     - **Privacy by Design**: Data remains on the user’s devices or the browser's sync service, minimizing exposure to external servers and reducing privacy concerns.
   - **Cons**:
     - **Limited Storage Quota**: Browser sync APIs have storage limits (e.g., Chrome’s `storage.sync` has a quota of 100KB per item and 8KB per key), which may restrict the data we can store.
     - **Sync Delays**: Syncing data across devices may experience delays or be inconsistent, depending on the browser’s sync service reliability.
     - **Browser Dependency**: Syncing depends on the user’s browser and may not work as expected if they use multiple browsers or browsers that do not support the sync API.

### 2. **Local Storage with Manual Export/Import**
   - **Pros**:
     - **Full User Control**: Users can manually export their data to a file and import it on another device, providing flexibility and control.
     - **No Sync Limitations**: Avoids browser sync quotas or delays issues.
   - **Cons**:
     - **Poor User Experience**: Manual syncing is cumbersome and inconvenient, especially for frequently switching devices.
     - **Error-Prone**: Manual processes are prone to user error and could lead to data loss if not handled carefully.

### 3. **Backend Server for Data Syncing**
   - **Pros**:
     - **Unlimited Storage**: A backend server could handle larger data volumes without the restrictions imposed by browser sync APIs.
     - **Custom Sync Logic**: Allows fine-grained control over syncing and managing data.
   - **Cons**:
     - **Complexity and Cost**: Managing a backend server introduces significant complexity, including infrastructure setup, security, and maintenance.
     - **Privacy and Security Concerns**: Storing user data on a server increases the risk of data breaches and requires implementing strict security measures.
     - **Resource Overhead**: Adds latency and potential performance issues compared to local storage.

## Decision
We have chosen to use **Local Storage and Browser Sync** as our syncing strategy. Data will be stored locally using browser cache (e.g., `localStorage` or `IndexedDB`), ensuring fast and efficient access. We will use the browser’s built-in sync API for syncing across devices, such as `chrome.storage.sync`. This approach allows us to maintain a lightweight and efficient extension while providing a reasonably good user experience for data syncing.

## Consequences
### Positive Consequences
- **Simplified Architecture**: No need to set up or maintain backend servers, reducing development and operational overhead.
- **Cost-Effective**: Eliminates costs associated with hosting and maintaining a backend, making the project easier to sustain long-term.
- **Lightweight and Responsive**: The extension remains performant, as data is accessed directly from the browser cache.
- **Seamless Syncing**: Users benefit from automatic data synchronization across devices, provided they are signed into their browser account.
- **Data Privacy**: User data remains within the browser ecosystem, reducing the risk of exposure to third parties.

### Negative Consequences
- **Storage Limitations**: The browser sync API’s storage quotas may constrain the amount of data we can sync, requiring careful management and optimization of stored data.
- **Browser Dependency**: Syncing is tied to the capabilities and reliability of the browser’s sync service, which may vary across browsers or fail if users do not use the same browser ecosystem.
- **Limited Offline Capabilities**: Although local storage allows for offline access, syncing data while offline will not be possible until the device reconnects to the internet.

### Trade-Offs
- **Simplicity vs. Scalability**: We traded off the scalability and flexibility of a backend server for the simplicity and speed of a serverless approach. This is acceptable given our current project requirements but may need to be revisited if the scope or data needs to expand.
- **Sync Reliability vs. User Control**: By relying on browser sync, we lose some control over syncing behavior but gain a more seamless experience than manual data management.

## Related Architectural Decisions
- **Data Structure Optimization**: Given the storage limitations of browser sync, we must design our data structures to be as efficient as possible, using techniques like data compression or minimizing redundant data.

## Notes and Future Considerations
- **Data Quota Management**: We may need to implement data pruning strategies or offer users options to manage and clean up old data if we approach storage limits.
- **Alternative Sync Solutions**: If user feedback indicates issues with browser sync reliability or storage limits, we could explore hybrid solutions, like optional cloud storage for power users.
- **Cross-Browser Support**: As the project evolves, we should test and optimize for sync behavior across different browsers and consider browser-specific limitations and features.

This decision ensures that our browser extension remains efficient and user-friendly while avoiding the complexity of backend infrastructure. We will monitor and adapt based on user needs and feedback.
